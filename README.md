## Team members

1. __Noor Ul Hassan (Team Lead)__
2. __Athar Naveed (Frontend Developer)__

## Technologies Used

We majorly used 2 technologies to build the entire platform:

1. __Next Js/TypeScript (Frontend)__
2. __FastAPI/Python (Backend)__
3. __Gemini v2.0 (AI Agent)__

## Purpose

Generally students face multiple issues during __their studies__ that are __only solvable__ by a teacher. And a teacher is not available all the time, and even if it is available. Its not __personalized__ according to a students need.

So, here we have __MindLoom__ that aims to solve student issues, providing them personalized responses, also students can give real time __quizes__ and get feedback. And finally, not all the students understand __concepts textually__ because humans remember visual concepts better than textual ones. MindLooms rescue students here with its video visualization feature providing real time __video generation__. And explaining it.
