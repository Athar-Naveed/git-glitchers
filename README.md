## Purpose

Generally students face multiple issues during __their studies__ that are __only solvable__ by a teacher. And a teacher is not available all the time, and even if it is available. Its not __personalized__ according to a students need.

So, here we have __MindLoom__ that aims to solve student issues, providing them personalized responses, also students can give real time __quizes__ and get feedback. And finally, not all the students understand __concepts textually__ because humans remember visual concepts better than textual ones. MindLooms rescue students here with its video visualization feature providing real time __video generation__. And explaining it.

## Future Works

There are endless possibilities in the field of education. Some of the possibilities that we have identified are:

1. Adding Online Leaderboards to the Quizzes.
2. Improving visualizations using __Evaluator agents__ and using __critiques__.
